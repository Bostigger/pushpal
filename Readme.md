# PushPal

PushPal is a lightweight CLI tool and Go package that scans for uncommitted and unpushed changes in a local Git repository. It also helps streamline your Git workflow by offering to automatically add frequently ignorable paths (like .idea/ and .vscode/) to your .gitignore file.

## Demo

https://github.com/Bostigger/pushpal/assets/52701136/32b1d746-a996-4430-80a1-05c50503da03

## Features

- Detect uncommitted changes in the active directory
-  Identify unpushed commits in the current directory
- Suggest adding often ignored paths to .gitignore if they contain changes
